                            Symbolically, this light means passing on to
                            you insights to guide you as you enter young
                            adulthood.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Allow me to share with you these 3 pointers:
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            (1) Turning 18 means you now have the right to
                            cast a vote. Your choice, your voice now matters.
                            Be very selective of the candidates you prefer to
                            elect in office. This right gives you so much
                            power. Exercise this right well. The first pointer is
                            SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    </div>
                    <div style="padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 1em;">
                        <p>
                            (2) Turning 18 also means you can now secure a
                            Professional Driver's License. Literally and figurativelly,
                            you are now the "driver" of your life. You now take
                            over the wheels. You already made your first major
                            decision in life by choosing which career to pursue. In
                            a few months, you will be in college. Learn as much
                            as you can in school. It'll give you the structure and
                            tools you will need once you start your career. The
                            second pointer is PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            (3) Third, we learn by doing so never be afraid to
                            make mistakes. Your parents and us, your
                            godparents, will see you through as you navigate the
                            complex world of adulthood. The last pointer is TRUST
                            YOURSELF.
