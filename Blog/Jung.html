                    To my mind, therapy only really begins after the investigation of that wholly personal story. 
                    It is the patient's secret, the rock against which he is shattered. 
                    If I know his secret story, I have the key to the treatment."

                        When I first read online quotations from Carl Gustav Jung taken from his book "Memories, Dreams, Reflections", I was immediately drawn to him. 
                        During an unexpected visit to Fully Booked Powerplant Rockwell on 2 Nov 2005, I saw this book from afar. 
                        It was placed a little above eye level position. What a coincidence!

                        How can a man whom I only encountered in a book made a big impact in my life? 
                        Jung came to me at the time when I was in a particular period of my life which can be best described with the following words of Dante Alighieri:

                        For the straightforward pathway had been lost.

                Jung provided me with a clear direction on how to navigate the untrodden path. 
                I owe him so much and I know that the best way to honor him is to share the light given to me by him. 
                Insights came by stages. It took me years to fully grasp the entire meaning and lesson.

            <u style="font-size: 1.5em;">The Story, The Dream, The Reflection</u>
            <p>
                
                There are three significant events in my life that I wish to focus on. 
                First, I grew up thinking that my introverted personality is a kind of defect that must be overcome. 
                I was never comfortable in my own skin. Second, I have two vivid memories of my pre-school year ---- i.e. 
                I cried heavily during the first day of school and I was whacked from "head to toe" when I refused to join the graduation practice. 
                Lastly, I left religious life after 13 years.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When I read and reflected on Jung's book, it was as if I became a little girl once more who was led by the hand of the 81-year-old Jung {Jung was 81 when he undertook the writing of his book]. 
                There was not much conversation. The hand that led me and his silent presence that conveyed acceptance and understanding eventually reached a depth that was incomprehensible for that little girl. 
                Through this encounter, a feeling of acceptance of my introverted personality without the need to explain myself, touched the very core of my being. 
                I was created that way. It was not a defect but a GIFT. Even that little girl who cried during the first day of school and was whacked for refusing to join the graduation rehearsal felt relieved after the assurance of complete acceptance of what she felt at that time. No explanation was required. It was just it. 
                There was no clear understanding on my part as a child why I was shy and why I cried during the first day of school or why I did not want to join the graduation practice. 
                It was just beyond the comprehension of a young mind after all. But as an adult, I know the reasons why.

                Parents, guardians and educators have a great responsibility to discover a child's uniqueness and value as the starting point or foundation of the child's development. 
                Herein lies the "treasure" God has given to each individual soul to be cultivated. 
                This is very crucial during the early stages of life or the formative years. It gives the child security to know and feel that he/she is accepted for who he/she is. 
                Moreover, accepting the child's feelings will help the child learn to trust himself/herself. 
                I finally figured out the root of my insecurity and self-distrust.

                Unlike my childhood experience, my leaving the religious life after 13 years came with due prayers and reflection. 
                It was a "willed choice”. Before and a few years after I left, I had a recurring dream. 
                I would see myself in the old apartment where we lived from my childhood until the beginning of my college years. 
                It's either I was inside the dimly lit third floor apartment or I was outside the main door in a very dark street. 
                In between, that's the second floor, I would always freeze every time I have to pass by either going down or up. 
                The second-floor apartment was as dark as the street outside. The darkness was not the reason why I would always want to skip this place. 
                It was because of the big possibility of seeing the ghost I saw in real life when I was a little girl. I do not remember exactly how old I was then. 
                But I have a vivid memory of how the ghost looked like. His hair was shiny because of the pomade. He was wearing a dark brown suit and with shiny black shoes. 
                I did not see his face. There was no face reflected on the mirror where he was facing. I did not notice if his feet were touching the floor or not. 
                I stared at him for a long time that is why I could remember him well. 
                Later, I saw a picture of him, that is why I could see his face in my dreams. 
                The ghost of this man baffled me. When I related this dream to a fellow nun, I was advised to pray for his soul. 
                Despite storming heaven with prayers, he kept appearing in my dreams.
                Very same dream. Then I thought, could he be the symbol of my animus? Is the descent and ascent to that apartment meant the journey to my deepest self? 
                Then one time, a thought struck me. "What was precisely the prominent feeling in that dream?”, I asked myself. 
                I gasped. It was FRIGHT! The decision to leave the religious life caused me so much fright. Dread. Terror. 
                After this realization, the dream never occurred again. Oh, so it meant I got the message of the dream???!!! I think so.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My encounter with Jung rectified incorrect notions about myself and fortified my "willed" decision to change the course of my life.

                After reading this short narrative, I hope I am able to awaken and inspire my readers to discover and embrace both the "beautiful and ugly" side of your real self. 
                Perfection is not the absence of flaw but the harmonious fusion of the seemingly "beautiful and ugly". Have faith in yourself. 
                Be the best that you can be. Make use of your God-given talents to make this world a better place to live in. Most of all, enjoy the journey!

                "The crucial thing is the story. For it alone shows the human background and the human suffering, and only at that point can the doctor's therapy begin to operate... So much is said in the literature about the resistance of the patient that it would almost seem as if the doctor is trying to put something over on him, whereas the cure ought to grow naturally out of the patient himself. Psychotherapy and analysis are as varied as are human individuals. I treat every patient as individually as possible, because the solution of the problem is always an individual one."
