                    Life took its unusual turn when my father was
                    diagnosed with lung cancer, which left my mother
                    to take on the heavy responsibility of being the
                    provider in the family. From a plain housewife who
                    did not finish college, she juggled two jobs to keep
                    the family afloat and ensure that the four of us
                    finish college after my father’s death a little more
                    than a year after the cancer diagnosis.</p>
                    <p>
                    When my father died, my sister was in third year
                    college, me in second year college and my two
                    brothers were both in fourth year high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My mother thought that it would have made a
                    big difference had she finished college. But with
                    her firm determination to give us a better chance
                    in life, my siblings and I all finished college. My
                    sister is a licensed nurse and my two brothers, one
                    a licensed civil engineer and the other a licensed
                    physical therapist.

                <p>During the last three and a half months of my
                    father’s illness (from the lungs, the cancer cells
                    went to the bones), my mother stayed with my
                    father in his hometown in Batangas where he
                    spent his last days. She personally cared for my
                    father as he battled with bone cancer while my
                    siblings and I visited them every weekend. The
                    four of us were left under the care of the priest
                    who officiated their marriage.</p>
                <p>She stayed on with the man whom she
                    vowed <i>"to have and to hold from this day
                    forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for
                    poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us
                    part."</i></p>
                    <br>
                <div class="p-headline">Woman</div>
                    <p>My mother evolved into a woman she has
                        become now ----- a woman of fortitude and
                        character who, after a sudden twist in life, came
                        out renewed. The school of life taught her that
                        adversity is part and parcel of our existence, and
                        that God has equipped us with the necessary
                        strength and grace to overcome it</p>
                    <p>In sum, she instilled in us, her children, the
                        importance of education and the values of hard
                        work and persistence. More than giving us life
                        and the best education, she showed us the way
                        to navigate the ups and downs of life.</p>
